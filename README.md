# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm Hyperparameters Optimization Using Wild Horse Optimizer

## About Project

In this project we development optimising support vector machine algorithm hyperparameters (kernel,c,gamma) in classification problems with using Wild Horse Optimizer as powerful and fast metaheuristic algorithm for solving engineering optimization problems

## How to Use

It's development and tested in MATLAB 2022a

first, you can use any dataset with edinting Main.m file and then click on Run
