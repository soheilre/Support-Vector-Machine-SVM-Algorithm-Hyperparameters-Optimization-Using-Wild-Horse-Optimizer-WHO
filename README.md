# SVM-Hyperparameters-Optimization-Using-Wild-Horse-Optimizer
Hello every one

In this project we development optimising svm hyperparameters (kernel,c,gamma) in classification problems with using Wild Horse Optimizer as powerful and fast * metaheuristic algorithm for solving engineering optimization problems

It's tested in MATLAB 2022a

you can read about this algorithm from below link:

Original MATLAB code that development by iraj Naruei in 2021:

How to use:
first, you can use any dataset with edinting Main.m file and then click on Run

Complete codes coming soon...

Thanks
